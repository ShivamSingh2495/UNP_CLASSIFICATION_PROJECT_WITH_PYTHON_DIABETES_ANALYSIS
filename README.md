# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_DIABETES_ANALYSIS

As part of my Diabetes Prediction Analysis project with UNP Education, I analyzed a medical dataset containing patient health information to predict diabetes risk. Using Python, I carried out data cleaning, missing value handling, and outlier treatment, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover significant health factors associated with diabetes. I implemented and evaluated machine learning models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to achieve accurate predictions and identify key influencing features. This project strengthened my expertise in data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, while deepening my understanding of how predictive analytics can support healthcare decision-making. The complete project files and codebase are available on GitHub for further improvement and study.
